PROCEDURE:
1.	Give connections as per the circuit diagram.
2.	Switch ON the supply, vary the RPS (Regulated Power Supply) and set a particular input voltage.
3.	Note down the readings of ammeters and voltmeters and tabulate them.
4.	Vary the RPS for different input voltages and note down the readings of all the meters.
5.	Reduce the RPS to its minimum value and switch OFF the supply.
6.	Using the tabulated values, verify Kirchoff’s laws practically, and verify it theoretically.
